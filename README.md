## Overview
<font size="1"> This repository contains a curated list of prompts designed to assist biologists in their research and work. The prompts were developed with the new ChatGPT o1-preview model in mind, given its advanced reasoning capabilities, but should be LLM agnostic. These prompts can help generate ideas, summarize complex topics, provide explanations, and guide you through data analysis processes—including writing Python or R code—for various subfields of biology. The repository also contains guidance on writing functional prompts, as that is the most important part of using LLM tools. The repository is currently designed for biologists in the human health space who have limited experience using generative AI tools or capabilities. It is an open source repository, intended to be expanded to encompass other subfields of biology and to be further refined as people use the existing prompts and add their own. I am NOT a prompt writing expert,
