## Overview
<font size="1"> This repository contains a curated list of prompts designed to assist biologists in their research and work using ChatGPT o1-preview as well as GPT-4o. These prompts can help generate ideas, summarize complex topics, provide explanations, and guide you through data analysis processes—including writing Python or R code—for various subfields of biology. The repository also contains guidance on writing functional prompts. The repository is currently designed for biologists in the human health space who have either limited computational experience or limited experience using generative AI tools or capabilities. It is an open source repository, intended to be expanded to encompass other subfields of biology and to be further refined as people use the existing prompts and add their own.
