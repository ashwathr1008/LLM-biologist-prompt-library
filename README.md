## Overview
<font size="1"> This repository contains a curated list of prompts designed to assist biologists in their research and work. The prompts were developed with the new ChatGPT o1-preview model in mind, given its advanced reasoning capabilities, but should be LLM agnostic. These prompts can help generate ideas, summarize complex topics, provide explanations, and guide you through data analysis processes—including writing Python or R code—for various subfields of biology. The repository also contains guidance on writing functional prompts, as that is the most important part of using LLM tools. The repository is currently designed for biologists in the human health space who have limited experience using generative AI tools or capabilities. It is an open source repository, intended to be expanded to encompass other subfields of biology and to be further refined as people use the existing prompts and add their own. I am NOT a prompt writing expert,

## Contributing
Please feel free to contribute and enhance this collection. Everyone's needs are different, and it is likely none of these prompts will work "plug and play" or "out of the box" for your particular purpose. These prompts are meant to provide guidance, a framework, and inspiration. Adding additional sections to cover other aspects of biology is also encouraged. My hope is that this repository will organically grow and improve as people use and add to it, so the next person to come across it has an easier time getting into LLM use than the previous person using it.
