# Experimental Design

1. Developing Hypotheses
    * "Help me develop hypotheses to investigate how changes in gut microbiome diversity affect immune responses in elderly populations."
    * "Help me formulate a clear and testable hypothesis for studying the effects of dietary supplements on athletic performance."
2. Sample Size Calculation:
    * "What factors should I consider when determining the sample size for my study on gene-environment interactions related to asthma risk? Provide formulas and tools for calculation."
    * "How do I calculate the appropriate sample size for a clinical trial comparing two treatments?"
5. Designing Experiments and Studies
    * "Help me design a controlled experiment to test the effects of a new drug on cancer cell proliferation in vitro."
    * "Design an experiment to compare the effects of a new anti-inflammatory drug in male vs. female mice. Outline how to ensure the groups are appropriately balanced and what variables should be controlled."
    * "What are the key considerations when designing a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a larger experiment?"
    * "Design a time course experiment to study gene expression changes during cell differentiation."
    * "Describe how to set up a factorial experiment to assess the interaction between two drugs."
    * "Explain how a crossover study design works and when it is appropriate to use it."
    * "Compare the advantages and disadvantages of longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs."
    * "How can I implement randomization in assigning subjects to control and treatment groups to minimize bias in the following experimental procedure? [Insert Procedure Here]" 
6. Choosing Appropriate Models
    * "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using mice as animal models for studying Alzheimer's disease?"
7. Selecting Experimental Techniques
    * "Suggest suitable techniques for measuring gene expression changes in response to stress in plants."
8. Data Collection Methods
    * "Suggest effective data collection methods for a study on patient adherence to medication regimens."
9. Minimizing Experimental Error
    * "How can I reduce measurement errors in experiments involving spectrophotometry?"
    * "I am recieving [Insert Error Here] error when running my experiment. The procedure is [Insert Procedure Here]. What is the most likely cause for this error"
10. Validation of Methods
    * "What are the tests needed to perform an analytical validation to CLIA and CAP standards?"
    * "What are the differences in tests needed to validate a new lab-developed test as compared to an existing assay"
    * "What is the expected Limit of Detection for the most commonly used [Insert test here] assays?"
    * "What would be a suitable comparator assay for verifying an equivalent [Insert test here] assay?"
11. Placebo Effects
    * "Discuss strategies to control for placebo effects in a clinical trial."
12. Addressing Confounding Variables
    * "What approaches can I take to identify and control confounding variables in an observational study?"
13. Power Analysis
    * "Explain the concept of statistical power and how to perform a power analysis for my experiment."
14. Adaptive Clinical Trials
    * "What are adaptive clinical trials, and how can they improve the efficiency of drug development?"
15. Designing Surveys and Questionnaires
    * "Provide guidelines for creating effective questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction."
16. Handling Missing Data
    * "What strategies can I use to handle missing data in my experimental results? The data I have is [Insert Data Here] and the data I am missing is [Insert Data Needed]."
17. Ethical Use of Animals
    * "What are the '3Rs' principles in animal research, and how can I implement them in my study design?"
