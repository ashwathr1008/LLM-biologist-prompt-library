# How to Write Effective Prompts
## Intro
Welcome! This tutorial is designed to help biologists with little AI experience get started with using generative AI tools like ChatGPT. 
By the end of this section, you'll have a better understanding of how to craft effective prompts to get the most out of AI assistants in your work.
While I have plenty of experience training people to perform lab processes, I don't actually have any experience training people to use AI tools, 
so please tell me what worked in this tutorial, and what you would have found helpful to change. I only recently started learning how to use AI tools,
but use of said tools is becoming more and more common, and many companies view knowing how to use AI as a bonus. I've more or less stumbled along on my 
own through trial and error, so I'm putting together my findings to make it easier for anyone else setting out on the same journey. Ultimately, the main
goal in using AI assistance like ChatGPT is to give you access to skills and knowledge you don't have yet. It won't substitute for genuine expertise or high
levels of experience, but it can get you the basics of skills fast, and it can process a lot of sources of information quickly. All of this potential, however,
is gated behind the prompts you as the user write.

## What is a Prompt?
What is a Prompt?
A prompt is a question or statement you provide to an AI language model to receive information, explanations, or assistance on a particular topic. 
The quality of the AI's response often depends on how well the prompt is crafted. It's important to remember what an AI tool can and can't do, and what
it is good at when writing prompts.

## General Tips for Writing Effective Prompts
1. Be Clear and Specific
    * Example: Instead of "Tell me about genes," ask "Explain the role of the BRCA1 gene in DNA repair mechanisms and its implications in breast cancer."
2. Provide Context
    * Example: "In the context of human stem cell research, how does DNA methylation influence gene expression?"
3. Specify the Desired Depth
    * Example: "Provide a detailed, graduate-level explanation of the Michaelis-Menten equation in enzyme kinetics."
4. Use Proper Terminology
    * Utilize scientific terms relevant to your field to get more accurate and detailed responses.

## Structuring Your Prompts
* Start with an Action Word: Begin your prompt with verbs like Explain, Describe, Compare, List, or Outline.
* Include the Main Topic: Clearly state the subject matter you want to explore.
* Add Specific Details or Parameters: Mention any particular aspects you want to focus on.

Example: "Describe (Action) the role of mitochondria (Main Topic) in energy production and apoptosis in human cells. (Specific Details)"

## Examples of Effective Prompts
1. Explaining Concepts
    * "Explain how mRNA vaccines stimulate an immune response against SARS-CoV-2."
2. Comparative Analysis
    * "Compare the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies versus traditional vaccines in treating viral infections."
3. Procedural Descriptions
    * "Outline the steps involved in conducting a PCR test for detecting viral RNA."
4. Implications and Applications
    * "Discuss the potential applications of stem cell therapy in regenerative medicine."
5. Clarifying Complex Topics
    * "Describe the mechanism by which epigenetic changes can lead to cancer."
6. Text Summarization
    * "Provide a concise summary of the following article: [Insert article text or key points here]."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Being Too Vague
    * Ineffective: "Tell me about cells."
    * Effective: "Describe the process of T-cell activation in the immune response."
2. Overly Broad Questions
    * Ineffective: "Explain cancer."
    * Effective: "Explain how mutations in the p53 gene contribute to the development of cancer."
3. Multiple Questions in One Prompt
    * Ineffective: "What is CRISPR, and how does PCR work?"
    * Effective: Split into two separate prompts for clarity.
4. Using Colloquial Language
    * Stick to scientific terminology for precision.

## Practice!!!
Try creating your own prompts using the structure and tips provided. Chances are, you won't get the result you precisely wanted. Refine your prompts based on the output until you get something you are satisfied with! Practice with prompt writing makes perfect. 

## Utilizing AI Responsibly
* **Fact-Checking:** *Always* verify information provided by AI with reputable scientific sources. If the AI offers up suggested articles to use as reference, double check the articles to make sure they exist. AI isn't all knowing, and delusions (instances where the AI makes up a likely response, such as an article that would report a certain finding that does not actually exist), while rare, and getting rarer as AI tools improve, do occassionally occur. When using AI to perform a task, you take the responsibility of fact checking yourself.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Be mindful of ethical guidelines and regulations in your field when discussing sensitive topics.
