# How to Write Effective Prompts
## Intro
Welcome! This tutorial is designed to help biologists with little AI experience get started with using generative AI tools like ChatGPT. 
By the end of this section, you'll have a better understanding of how to craft effective prompts to get the most out of AI assistants in your work.
While I have plenty of experience training people to perform lab processes, I don't actually have any experience training people to use AI tools, 
so please tell me what worked in this tutorial, and what you would have found helpful to change. I only recently started learning how to use AI tools,
but use of said tools is becoming more and more common, and many companies view knowing how to use AI as a bonus. I've more or less stumbled along on my 
own through trial and error, so I'm putting together my findings to make it easier for anyone else setting out on the same journey. Ultimately, the main
goal in using AI assistance like ChatGPT is to give you access to skills and knowledge you don't have yet. It won't substitute for genuine expertise or high
levels of experience, but it can get you the basics of skills fast, and it can process a lot of sources of information quickly. All of this potential, however,
is gated behind the prompts you as the user write.

## What is a Prompt?
What is a Prompt?
A prompt is a question or statement you provide to an AI language model to receive information, explanations, or assistance on a particular topic. 
The quality of the AI's response often depends on how well the prompt is crafted. It's important to remember what an AI tool can and can't do, and what
it is good at when writing prompts.
